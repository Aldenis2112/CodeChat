This document takes a hands-on, breadth-first approach to introducing assembly langauge. Rather than explain all concepts before they're used, this document enables you to experiment with then to find out what really works, then reinforces thae hands-on intuition you've developed with a minimal amount of explanation. Perform the exercises, or you'll lose much of the available learning.
