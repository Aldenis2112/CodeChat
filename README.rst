*****************************
A programmer's word processor
*****************************

`CodeChat <https://pythonhosted.org/CodeChat/README.html>`_ transforms source code into a web page, allowing developers to view their program as a beautiful and descriptive document by adding headings, formatting, hyperlinks, diagrams, images, and other forms of rich content to capture the ideas and insights that naturally flow from the process of writing a program. It also provides a blank slate in which to plan ahead, by sketching out an algorithm before committing it to code or laying out a design document which can evolve as the code does. This `literate programming <http://www.literateprogramming.com/>`_ paradigm changes the way developers think by intermingling ideas with their implementation as code, dramatically improving a programmerâ€™s abilities.

Tutorial
========
The `tutorial <https://pythonhosted.org/CodeChat/tutorial.html>`_ guides new users into using CodeChat's literate programming abilities. Start here! Or, peruse the examples below to see the ways in which CodeChat transforms plain source code into beautiful documents.

Examples
========
Some examples of literate programming using CodeChat:

* Use of a ``toctree`` directive to categorize all source files in `CodeChat itself <https://pythonhosted.org/CodeChat/>`_
* Use of tables to help design a `simple parser <https://pythonhosted.org/CodeChat/CodeChat/CodeToRest.html#preserving-empty-lines-of-code>`_.
* Use of GraphViz to illustrate a `simple state machine <https://pythonhosted.org/CodeChat/CodeChat/CodeToRest.html#summary-and-implementation>`_.
* Use of hyperlinks to provide reference information for all `Sphinx configuration values <https://pythonhosted.org/CodeChat/conf.html>`_.
* Use of fonts to show what ``setup.py`` `commands to run <https://pythonhosted.org/CodeChat/setup.html>`_
* Use of a screenshot to demonstrate the operation of a `3-D simulation <https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2337351/CodeChat_MAVs/homework_1_solution.html>`_.
* Use of equations and diagrams in `scientific computing <https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2337351/CodeChat_MAVs/mav3d_simulation.html#dynamics>`_.
* Use of equations to explain the resulting code for an `integrator <https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2337351/CodeChat_MAVs/integrating_omega_3d.html>`_.
* CodeChat is used for code examples in a course on `microprocessors <http://www.ece.msstate.edu/courses/ece3724/main_pic24/docs/sphinx/textbook_examples.html>`_.

Contributing
============
This is a fairly basic implementation; much improvement is needed! Please use the `issue tracker <http://bitbucket.org/bjones/documentation/issues?status=new&status=open>`_ to report bugs or request features; even better, or contribute to the code at the CodeChat_ homepage!
