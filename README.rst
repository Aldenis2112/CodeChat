Welcome to the documentation system!

Getting started
===============
To get up and running, you'll need to do some software installs. In addition to
the code in this package, you'll need

* Install Python, v 2.7.2. I haven't tested with any other version.
* Install Sphinx, v 1.1.2. I haven't tested with any other version.
* Install MikteX (optional, to generate math formulas viewable in this
  application). On the first run, you'll be prompted to install a few additional
  MikTeX packages.
* Some source code to document. Currently, only C/C++ and Python are supported.
