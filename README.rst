CodeChat, a conversational coding system
========================================

Welcome to CodeChat_, a conversational coding system. CodeChat encourages `literate programming <http://www.literateprogramming.com/>`_ by transforming source files into web pages and by providing a simple editor which synchronizes between the source code view and the web view of a document. Some examples of the results:

- Explaining to myself what my code should do helped me rewrite and fix `CodeToRest <https://dl.dropbox.com/u/2337351/CodeChat/doc/CodeChat/CodeToRest.py.html>`_.
- Likewise, explaining how a micro air vehicle responds to force created by its rotors enabled me to develop a `simulation of it <https://dl.dropbox.com/u/2337351/MAV_class/Python_tutorial/mav3d_simulation.py.html>`_.

Getting started
---------------
First, download then run `Install_CodeChat.exe <https://dl.dropbox.com/u/2337351/CodeChat/Install_CodeChat.exe>`_ to install the program. To create a new CodeChat project, select ``File | Create new project`` and place it in a directory of your choosing, then follow the directions that appear.

Optional modules
----------------
You may optionally install:

* `MiKTeX <http://miktex.org>`_ to generate math formulas viewable in this application. On the first run, you'll be prompted to install a few additional MiKTeX packages.
* `GraphViz <http://www.graphviz.org/>`_ to create graphs.

Recent changes
--------------
- Window title shows current project directory and open file.
- Added ``Create new project``, bug fixes.
- Added a window to show output from the Sphinx build process.
- Save/restore window geometry.
- Support for PHP, MATLAB files.
- Make matched text in browser/code views more visible.
- Enable double-click to switch views.
- Improve matching between views.
- Additional help menu items.

Contributing
------------
This is a fairly basic implmentation; much improvement is needed! Please use the `issue tracker <http://bitbucket.org/bjones/documentation/issues?status=new&status=open>`_ to report bugs or request features; even better, or contribute to the code at the CodeChat_ homepage!
