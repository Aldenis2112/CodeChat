CodeChat
========

Welcome to CodeChat, a conversational coding system. CodeChat encourages literate programming by transforming source files into web pages and by providing a simple editor which synchronizes between the source code view and the web view of a document.

Getting started
===============
To create a new CodeChat project:

* Copy the files from ``<path to CodeChat>/template`` to a directory of your choosing.
* In CodeChat, choose ``File | Choose project dir`` and select the directory you chose above.
* In CodeChat, choose ``File | Open`` and ``open contents.rst``.
* Begin documenting! Currently, only C/C++, Python, and reST are supported. The source files in ``<path to CodeChat>/src`` provide many examples of the use of this system.

Optional modules
================
In addition to the code in this package, you may optionally install:

* `MiKTeX <http://miktex.org>`_ to generate math formulas viewable in this
  application. On the first run, you'll be prompted to install a few additional
  MiKTeX packages.
* `GraphViz <http://www.graphviz.org/>`_ to create graphs.
